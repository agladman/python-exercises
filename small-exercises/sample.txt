This is a file that contains some words. Random ones that can be looped over, analysed, whatever. And another thing is that at the moment it isn't really long enough so I expect there to be very few repeated words at the moment. The more I write the more will become repeated. Repetition is going to happen in this file of random words. Then, when it is looped over by some program or other, perhaps a decent amount of words will be available for the program to work on.

And another thing is that there needs to be a few lines in here.

Soft wrap just has things as one line even though it looks like lots of lines.
And even now there are only six. How many is that. It's one more than five. One less than six. So there.

Bum. And up your bum. The references to arses should not be listed by the hapax finding program as it is meant to ignore capitalisation.
